# Fintech-Project-File-
This repository contains all the ficntech projects I undertook during my time in Politecnico di Milano 

The goal of the repository is to inform the reader about my experience with different technological tools relevent to the fintech sector in which I aspire to enter. Languages covered are Python, R and Solidity with which I was able to provide a verdict on financial problems with the use of data leveraging the aforementioned technologies. Notably the topics tackled were on: Credit Approval Algorithm, Time series Securities Ananlysis, Value at Risk and Portfolio Choices. Under every folder the reader can find the resources(data), the source code and a brief description of the goals of the projects and subsequently significant findingst tied to the latter.
