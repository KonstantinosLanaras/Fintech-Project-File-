The project “Optimizing Automated Credit Issuance: P2P Republic” addresses the NPL challenge and suggests an automated algorithm-based solution. The specific area of focus is peer-to-peer lending, where data is widely available and could serve as a basis for an automated underwriting system. The objective is to replace slow, biased manual loan assessments with an algorithmic scoring model that improves risk detection while maintaining portfolio quality. Using the Lending Club dataset (over 390,000 loans from 2007–2016), we framed the task as a binary classification problem: predict whether a loan will be repaid or not (NPL) based on customer characteristics (features).

After data cleaning and feature engineering, a logistic regression model was developed to identify which KPIs (describing my customer characteristics) significantly impact repayment probability. Significant association was found between default rates and factors such as loan amount, income, debt-to-income ratio, employment status, and verification status. Multicollinearity tests confirmed the robustness of the selected variables, and statistical significance testing highlighted the strongest predictors of default. 

The final model achieved an AUC of approximately 0.71, indicating a solid ability to distinguish between repaid and defaulted loans. The analysis also emphasized the importance of threshold selection, showing the trade-off between approving more borrowers and minimizing costly defaults. In the banking context, a higher threshold selection might be preferred because of the tremendous negative impact of non-performing loans on banks’ profitability, despite the resulting reduction in approved but creditworthy borrowers. The project demonstrates how automated underwriting can enhance decision quality and reduce non-performing loans. A methodology that can potentially be applied in a wider array of financial institutions, such as fintech platforms providing credit or even traditional banks.
