This document is a 1-day and 10-day Value at Risk analysis using individual bank stocks, applying parametric and historical simulation approaches. It is a didactical exercise; meanwhile, it uses real-world data and showcases my understanding of VaR, a popular financial risk tool. More specifically, simple historical and weighted historical VaR are applied. This research delves into extreme loss scenarios and tail-risk behavior.
