Portfolio choices

In this document, time series data of six different stocks are analysed using R. It is a didactical exercise showing my ability to work with time series data and my knowledge of basic finance theory, but also its limitations. The mean and variance are computed initially, along with descriptive statistics, to give the reader a better idea of the return distribution and to perform the necessary computations for portfolio optimisation. Subsequently, the mean–variance criterion is applied, where utility and the concept of risk aversion are introduced. Furthermore, the minimum variance portfolios are computed with and without implementing correlation. Lastly, the tangency portfolio is computed (maximum Sharpe ratio), showing how correlation affects weight distribution and how it is influenced by the return and risk of each asset.
