GOLD vs S&P 500 – What is the role of gold in today’s market
In the attached file, my code formed the basis for a time-series analysis of the role of gold as an asset in today’s market, in light of the latest concurrent bull runs of the S&P 500 and gold. The approach taken was:
•	recognise and compute bull and bear market runs for gold and the S&P 500
•	compute the overlap ratio, i.e. to what extent market trends occur simultaneously
•	compute the correlation between the assets and identify anomalies
The analysis supports the conclusion that gold still constitutes a hedge against market volatility in the case of negative events, as shown by the latest stress periods in the correlation charts. A further study has been proposed to include the USD index and the 30-year Treasury yield index in order to deepen the analysis, as we observe a deterioration of the USD’s role in global markets, spurring increased demand for gold by emerging economies’ central banks and asset managers.
